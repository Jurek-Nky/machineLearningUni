define machine learning:
	learning from existing input and output data to predict precise output from new input data

is sorting a good application:
	no because depends on the type of data. only edgecases where it would be more efficient 
	than normal sorting algs. 

5 applications of machine learning:
	everything...

how can we evaluate machine learning algorithms:
	by the delta they produce on the given data on average, least amout of errors

what is an optimal function:
	a function that produces no errors(minimizes error) on any given input

what is a model? linear model? non-linear model:
	

what is prediction in machine learning:
	the output of a function on a given set of inputs


2:
what could the rows correspond to:

what could the columns correspond to:

how can you plot the data:
	using f1 and f2 as x and y axis and ploting the given data????

Do you see a problem with the perfect function:
	
3:
approach to qualify models:
	add up the absolute of all errors and divide them by the number of datasets

should you test on the data the model was trained on:
	no because we need new data for testing otherwise we could just use the optimal function

valid approach to train and evaluate:
	use a datasplit and use one part for training and the other for testing. usually 66% to 33%
