define machine learning:
	learning from existing input and output data to predict precise output from new input data

is sorting a good application:
	no because its difficult to select the attributes to sort

5 applications of machine learning:


how can we evaluate machine learning algorithms:
	by the delta they produce on the given data on average, least amout of errors

what is an optimal function:
	a function that produces no errors on any given input

what is a model? linear model? non-linear model:
	

what is prediction in machine learning:
	the output of a function on a given set of inputs
